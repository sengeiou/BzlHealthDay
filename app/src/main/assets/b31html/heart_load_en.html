<h3>Medical examination</h3>
	<p>
    The normal heart load value is 20pi-40pi, and the average or maximum value exceeds this interval, which is the heart overload: an upward red arrow appears after the value is displayed. If the long-term cardiac load is too heavy, it is recommended to seek medical advice and comprehensive examination to avoid cardiac risk.
	</p>
	</div>
<div>
	<h3>Glossary</h3>
		<p>Cardiac load refers to the perfusion index, which reflects the pulsatile blood flow.</p>
</div>
<div>
	<h3>Typical condition</h3>
		<p>The pi value, the heart rate and blood pressure are high, the breathing is short, and there is often a feeling of fatigue.</p>
</div>
<div>
	<h3>Treatment</h3>
		<p>Ensure adequate rest, don't overwork and stay up all night, relax your mind, avoid mental stress, and eat less greasy food. If there is no improvement, it is recommended to seek medical advice in time and do comprehensive medical examination</p>

	<h3>Common sense of Heart load</h3>
	<p>The cardiac load is divided into:</p>
	<p>①cardiac preload;</p>
    <p>② cardiac post-load.</p>
    <p>Cardiac preload, also known as volumetric load, refers to the load before myocardial contraction, which is actually a response to ventricular end-diastolic volume or end-diastolic wall tension. Post-load refers to the resistance or load after myocardial contraction, also known as pressure load. Aortic pressure and pulmonary artery pressure are the post-load of the left and right ventricles.
    </p>
	<p>1、Cardiac preload</p>
	<p> The major factors of increased cardiac preload and possible heart problems:</p>
	<p>①Valvular lesions, the second, tricuspid and aortic regurgitation can increase the volume load, and the narrowing of the mitral and tricuspid valves can reduce the volume load.</p>
	<p>②Internal and external shunt diseases: atrial septal, ventricular septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus can increase the load.</p>
	<p>③Systemic blood volume changes: a large amount of fluid, hyperthyroidism, chronic anemia, etc. in a short period of time can increase the load.Hyperkine, diarrhea, blood loss, etc. lead to a reduction in effective circulating blood volume, which can reduce the preload. Left ventricle is in aorta, mitral regurgitation, and congenital heart disease from right to left or left to right; right ventricle is in atrial septal defect, pulmonary valve or tricuspid regurgitation; two ventricles pressure Excessive load: severe anemia, hyperthyroidism, beriberi heart disease and arteriovenous fistula.
	</p>
	<p> 2、Cardiac Post-load</p>
	<p>The major factors of increased cardiac post-load and possible heart problems:</p>
	<p>① Aortic compliance: that is the ability of the aortic content to expand with the increase of the wall of the vessel, with thickening of the vessel wall, the compliance is reduced.</p>
	<p>②Peripheral vascular resistance: It depends on the transverse area of the small arterial vascular bed and vascular tone, the latter is affected by vascular and humoral factors.</p>
	<p>③Blood viscosity: When the blood viscosity is increased, the peripheral vascular resistance is increased.</p>
	<p>④Circulating blood volume. Among them, peripheral vascular resistance is the most important, and it is often used as an indicator of left ventricular post-load in clinic. Left ventricular post-load is in hypertension, aortic outflow tract obstruction (aortic stenosis, aortic coarctation); right ventricular post-load is in pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary stenosis, obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary embolism.</p>
