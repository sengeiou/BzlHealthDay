<h3>Medical examination</h3>
	<p>
    More than 30 apneas (no breathing for 10 seconds or more) for 7 consecutive hours of sleep or over 5 times of average number of hypopneas per hour (reduced or completely stopped breathing), 
		may be considered as sleep apnea Syndrome. If there is no improvement in the long term, please seek medical advice promptly, comprehensively check and take treatment.

<h3>Typical symptoms</h3>
<p>
(1)Clinical syndrome during the day:
<br>①Lethargy；
<br>②dizziness and weakness；
<br>③abnormal mental state；
<br>④headache；
<br>⑤irritability, anxiety, etc.;
<br>
(2)Clinical syndrome at night:
<br>① Snoring: irregular snoring, snoring - airflow stop - panting - humming alternately;
<br>②Apnea: terminated with gasping, waking or loud snoring;
<br>③Wake up: often accompanied by turning over, limbs involuntary movement or even convulsions or suddenly sit-up, feeling palpitation, chest tightness or discomfort in the pre-cordial area;
<br>④Hyperactivity: turning over at night and turning frequently;
<br>⑤Sweating, increased nocturia;
<br>⑥Abnormal sleep behavior: manifested as fear, exclamation, slang, night travel, auditory hallucinations. In addition, fat, turbinate hypertrophy, snoring, etc. are also likely to cause apnea syndrome.

<h3>Common sense of the Apnea syndrome</h3>
</p>
<p>1、Is sleep apnea syndrome harmful?</p>
<p>A: Sleep apnea syndrome is a chronic disease. It is difficult to detect when the disease is caused. Early illness is not easy to be taken seriously. Once the breathing is not smooth, it will cause snoring or the lungs will be deprived of oxygen and blood oxygen will drop, which affects the rest and recovery of the body so that the mental state and physical condition are poor and the quality of life is significantly reduced. More seriously, if there is the lack of external stimuli when the apnea occurs, the patient is difficult to wake up, until the body organs are hypoxic or even damaged and then they suddenly wake up, which patients often do not care. Long-term continuous accumulation of damage will ultimately cause various Cardiovascular, vascular diseases and mental illness, even sudden death.</p>
<p>2、How is this disease caused?</p>
<p>A: Most are caused by obstruction of the upper airway including turbinate hypertrophy, tonsil hypertrophy, short mandibular neck, thick neck circumference and general obesity. Therefore, sleep apnea syndrome is mostly obstructive, and part of it is caused by respiratory central nervous system injury, respiratory regulation dysfunction, which is called central or a mixture of both.
</p>

<p>3、 How do you know if you are a patient with sleep apnea syndrome?</p>
<p>A: Whether there are typical clinical symptoms and signs, simple judgment can be made. However, due to the characteristics of chronic diseases and lack of monitoring equipment, it is difficult for patients to feel their nocturnal symptoms during sleep. Descriptions by family and self-perception are lack of scientific basis which will cause misjudgment. Only after the illness was severe, the patient realized that he was going to the hospital for a diagnosis. The standard method is polysomnography (PSG). By taking blood oxygen monitoring as the core and combining with physiological parameters such as ECG, EEG, EMG, and ocular electricity, the type and extent of the disease can be accurately understood. At this time, the condition has often entered a more serious stage, the difficulty, cost of treatment and the discomfort of the patients have increased significantly. So the sooner the diagnosis, the better.</p>
<p>4、How to treat sleep apnea syndrome?</p>
<p>
  A: At present, there are few studies on central sleep apnea syndrome. In addition to active treatment of respiratory dysfunction (primary disease), there is still no effective treatment, but usually central sleep apnea syndrome does not exist alone, so the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is also effective. Treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome usually requires treatment options based on the severity of the illness. No matter which method is used to treat apnea syndrome, there are two ways. First, through the detection mechanism, when apnea occurs, it is interrupted by external stimuli. For example, when apnea is accompanied by severe hypoxia, Awaken or wake up can reduce the duration of apnea which will reduce or avoid damage to the body organs; Second, do not need detection mechanism and always maintain treatment status to avoid apnea.
</p>
<p>5、 What is the use of blood oxygen monitoring for sleep apnea syndrome?</p>
<p>For patients with sleep apnea syndrome, blood oxygen monitoring has the following advantages:</p>
<p>①During period of the snoring into an apnea phase, the warning indicates the risk of illness.</p>
<p>②In the early stage of the disease, it can be used as a basis for diagnosis and remind patients to seek medical treatment earlier to reduce the difficulty of treatment and the cost of treatment, and also increase the chance of cure.</p>
<p>③In the treatment stage, timely monitoring of night conditions and feedback of treatment effects.</p>
<p>④ It can be used as an important basis for detecting apnea.It can be used to wake-up and monitor symptoms.</p>
